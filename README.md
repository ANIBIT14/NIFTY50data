# NIFTY50data
It is a single .py file that give NIFTY50 index data in a csv file for the dates given by user.

This code extracts particularly  NIFTY 50 Index data from 
https://nseindia.com/products/content/equities/indices/historical_index_data.htm
for the time period given by user and stores in a .csv file.

It also contains code applying rolling statistics on the extracted data, but that part has been commented out.
We can use this code to extract datafrom different index from the same site with some modification.

The drawback of this code is it's execution time which can be reduced very much by some suggestions given in the .py file.
It can be optimized in many ways as it is an initial file.

I will be developing it further to make it best in extracting NIFTY50 data and everyone interested is invited to make this program better.
